<h1>What is Crabigatorism?</h1>

<p>Crabigatorism is a non-recognized (by the world government) religion and/or cult that believes in a thing or two.</p>

<p>In Crabigatorism, we worship the Crabigator, a giant crab-alligator hybrid who feeds on upon our learning and suffering. There are many sects or cults that celebrate the Crabigator in their own ways. For  example, one offshoot of the Church of Crabigatorism performs worship through constant kanji reviews. Quite appropriate, considering the ancient doctrine! By suffering and overcoming enough learning challenges, we are permited into the final challenge of hell.</p>

<p>The Church of Crabigatorism accepts all who are willing to learn and suffer for the Crabigator, so long as that learning is applied to that which is good and just.</p>
