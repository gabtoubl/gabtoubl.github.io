<h1>Prayer</h1>

<p>When it comes to prayer, acolytes of Crabigatorism are required only one thing: to spend one hour of their day free from durtling. That is, spend an hour in boredom.</p>

<p>The particularly devout will spend time sitting, doing nothing but looking at the scenery and people walking by. This helps to reset the durtling we are bombarded with on a daily basis by ads, people, our phones, our emails, social media, and so on. When everything butters up our dopamine receptors, nothing will. We must reset.</p>

<p>Lower level or newer members of Crabigatorism will spend time doing "boring" activities, like sewing, reading something educational, or doing their kanji lessons and reviews. The point is to do something that doesn't exist to entertain you. Fictional literature was written to entertain you, so it should not be a part of your prayer. TV exists to entertain you, except for the most boring of documentaries. You get the picture. To pray to the Crabigator, be bored, and do it on purpose. The more boring it is, and the more you're okay with it, the closer you are to the eternal challenge that only Hell provides.</p>

<p>These are the most basic forms of prayer one can do. For more complicated prayer, inner-circle members should refer to the intranet.</p>
