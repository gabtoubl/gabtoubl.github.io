<h1>What Makes Crabigatorism Unique?</h1>

<p>Crabigatorism is unlike any other cult or religion you've ever tried in your life. For example, we <em>rarely</em> mention Jesus in our version of the bible.</p>

<p>Also, we don't believe in heaven, only hell. Okay, fine, we do believe in both, but our goal is to be accepted iinto hell when we die. That is where the challenge is, and that challenge will bring us satisfaction. Our belief is that only by going deeper into hell may we get closer to enlightment. It is only through the pain and suffering of learning that we will be accepted into the Crabigator's clawy, and fiery, embrace.</p>

We also have some <a href="toilet-law.html">unique toilet culture</a>.
